          IdeaTracker+ was born out of a simple realization: great ideas can strike at any moment, but without the right tools, they can easily be forgotten.
          Our founders, a group of passionate innovators and developers, experienced this firsthand and decided to create a solution. Combining their expertise
          in technology and a shared vision for fostering creativity, they developed IdeaTracker+.
